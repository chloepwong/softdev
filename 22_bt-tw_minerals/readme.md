Time Spent: 1  

DISCO:  
- Tailwind classes can be used to style specific aspects of HTML elements (e.g., font size)  
- Bootstrap classes offer styling for specific pre-made features (e.g., navigation bar)  
- Tailwind classes can be more freely modified than Bootstrap classes  

Q/C/C:  
- Can I reasonably use Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Foundation all in one project?  

q0: 2  

q0b: N/A  

q1: I prefer Foundation because it provides styling for pre-made features while remaining easily customizable. This allows devos to create personalized sites without putting too much effort into its style.
