K35 -- p00 by GitHub Copilot
2024-03-17
Time Spent:

DISCO:
- There is a creepy face in the Copilot interface
- Copilot prefers to use SQLAlchemy over SQLite3
- Copilot did not write all the files in its directory structure, and it wrote files not included in the structure

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
C: Copilot crashed and closed itself
C: Copilot slows down as it writes more files
