K35 -- p00 by GitHub Copilot
2024-03-17
Time Spent: 1.5 hours

DISCO:
- There is a creepy face in the Copilot interface
- Copilot prefers to use SQLAlchemy over SQLite3
- Copilot did not write all the files in its directory structure, and it wrote files not included in the structure
- Copilot tells you where it got its code from and 

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: It took us two tries to "get it right."
q1: We noticed Copilot trying to use SQLAlchemy, so we kindly asked it to use SQLite3 instead. When we saw that our first attempt resulted in a failing app, we decided to start over with new prompts.
q2: The bot's output includes database related code in the main app.py file. It also hashes user passwords, which we did not ask it to do.
C: Copilot crashed and closed itself
C: Copilot slows down as it writes more files
