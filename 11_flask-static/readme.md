I expect http://localhost:5000/static/foo to not show anything.
A file with the plaintext in foo is downloaded when I access the file via http://localhost:5000/static/foo.

I expect http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html to show "Is this plaintext, though?" when the second function is commented out.
I expect it to show a random number when it is not commented out.
These predictions seem true.
