Notes:
sudo apt update
    - You have enter your password after sudo-ing
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-setuptools
    -Very cool progress bar when apt installing
sudo apt install python3-venv
    - outputs some stuff like no vm guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries on this host
mkdir ~/myproject
cd ~/myproject
    - 
python3.10 -m venv myprojectenv
source myprojectenv/bin/activate
    -makes vm
pip install wheel
pip install uwsgi flask
    - new loading bar thats like a spinning wheel
    - took a while to finish
nano ~/myproject/myproject.py
    -
uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:5000 --protocol=http -w wsgi:app
    - took long to run, website displays internal server error
    - need to import project_name from app in wsgi.py
configuration file (myproject.ini)
domain needs a '.XXX'
-
Q: 
what is source (source myprojectenv/bin/activate)
what is wheel (pip install wheel)
what is uWSGi and why is it stylized like that
does it matter where you foistapp
why is there two domain ips when you run the app? and why do only one of them work?
    - maybe because its running on the droplet server

-
C:
after running sudo systemctl start myproject
-warning: unit file source config file or dropins of myfoint.... Run systemctl daemon-reload to reload units
installing nginx is a prerequisite (who knew)
