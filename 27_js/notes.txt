DISCO:
- Stack overflow occurs when the function has called itself too many times and the program runs out of memory
- console.log() can be used to print to the console
- <script> can be used to retrieve and run JavaScript

QCC:
- Why is "undefined" printed in the console when you set a variable (e.g., let x = 5)?
- Are there any differences between let and var?
